Create a clean, professional architecture diagram for a web application called "NeuroCalm".

Style:
- Minimalist, flat design aesthetic.
- Soft, calm, and accessible color palette (light blues, greys, white).
- Use rounded rectangles for components and simple, thin lines for connectors.
- Subtle shadows for depth.
- No people, faces, or decorative clutter.
- High-resolution for presentations.
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9

Layout:
- A large rounded rectangle labeled "User's Browser (Client-Side Only)" should contain all internal components.
- Inside, show three main blocks: "Angular UI" (with icons for text fields and buttons), "State Management (Signals)", and "Gemini Service (API Logic)".
- An arrow should flow from "Angular UI" to "Gemini Service".
- An arrow should flow from "Gemini Service" out of the "User's Browser" container to an external block labeled "Google Gemini API".
- A prominent label at the bottom should read: "Stateless Design: No Server, No Database, No Data Stored".

Purpose:
To visually explain the client-side, stateless architecture of the application to a semi-technical audience.
