Create a high-level, conceptual product vision diagram for an AI tool called "NeuroCalm".

Style:
- Abstract and minimalist.
- Calm and reassuring visual tone.
- Soft pastel color palette (calm blues, gentle greens).
- Use simple shapes and fluid lines.
- No text except for key labels.
- No people, faces, or technical icons.
- High-resolution for a pitch deck.
- Aspect Ratio: 16:9

Layout:
- A clear left-to-right flow in three parts.
- Part 1 (Left): A complex, tangled shape made of overlapping lines and faded, chaotic text fragments. Label it "Information Overload".
- Part 2 (Center): A simple, clean, serene circle or soft rectangle that acts as a filter. Label it "NeuroCalm". An arrow should pass from the left shape through this central filter.
- Part 3 (Right): The output from the filter is a set of clean, simple, organized shapes: a stack of horizontal bars (representing bullet points) and a checklist. Label it "Structured Clarity".

Purpose:
To communicate the core value proposition of NeuroCalm: transforming cognitive complexity into calm, clear understanding.
